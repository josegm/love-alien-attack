# GAME DESCRIPTION

It'll be a survival game.

The player will be at the bottom of the screen. Aliens will fall down. Player
will have to ways to fire, one button to fire UP, so it kills the aliens while
they're falling and another button to fire horizontally, so he can also kill
the aliens that get to the ground. Aliens once on the ground are not very fast
moving, they crawl. Player is faster so he can avoid them by jumping over them.

# TODO

Sprites for the player and aliens will be crude at the beginning, we can
improve them once the game is playable.

- Draw the ground
- Draw the player (simple)
- Make the player move (left and right)
- Draw an alien
- Make an alien fall from the sky
- Make several aliens fall from the sky randomly
- If an alien touches the player, player is killed (implement)
- Make the player jump
- When an alien reaches the ground, the alien crawls to the player
- Make player1 able to fire up (bullet system will probably be the hardest part
  to implement)
- Make player1 able to horizontally
- Make aliens die if hit by a bullet
- Score
