# GAME DESCRIPTION

It'll be a survival game.

The player will be at the bottom of the screen. Aliens will fall down. Player
will have to fire, one button to fire UP, so it kills the aliens while
they're falling and another button to fire horizontally, so he can also kill
the aliens that get to the ground. Aliens once on the ground are not very fast
moving, they crawl. Player is faster so he can avoid them by jumping over them.

# TODO

improve them once the game is playable.
